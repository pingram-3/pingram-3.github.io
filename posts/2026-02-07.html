        <h1>My First Cybersecurity Hackathon</h1>

        <p>
          Last quarter, I took what has been my favorite course in my
          undergraduate degree, Computer Security. The course taught me concepts
          that have stuck with me, like vulnerability analysis, system security
          concepts, and the mindset required to think like an attacker. About
          halfway through this quarter, the professor invited me to participate
          in a week-long DARPA-hosted hackathon with his research group. The
          goal was to analyze Android APK files and exploit known
          vulnerabilities on Android version 13.0 (“Tiramisu”).
        </p>

        <p>
          On the first day of the hackathon, I was overwhelmed with the task of
          exploiting fully developed applications. Unlike the project
          assignments in the Computer Security course (that were designed to be
          exploited), there were no instructional guides. The codebases were
          unfamiliar, the attack surface was unclear, and I had to learn the
          process of how real vulnerability research actually begins.
        </p>

        <p>
          After getting familiar with using the jadx decompiler, learning how to
          use LLMs as research assistants, and researching Common
          Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), I successfully reproduced a path
          traversal exploit in an Adobe Reader APK. Reproducing the exploit
          required understanding how file paths were handled by the application,
          how Android app storage works, and how insufficient input sanitization
          could allow access to unintended directories. The results from this
          reproduction were included in the group’s final write-up.
        </p>

        <p>
          This hackathon was the first time I applied concepts from a security
          course to real software systems. It showed me how much breadth is
          required to move from understanding vulnerabilities conceptually to
          reproducing them in practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          This experience has allowed me to gain a perspective on security
          research. Reading exploit write-ups is very different from reproducing
          them, and reproducing them is very different from discovering new
          ones. My goal moving forward is to continue building the systems
          knowledge necessary to eventually develop my own unique exploits.
        </p>

        <p>
          My next step in my cybersecurity journey is to continue working with
          this professor and his research group in learning tool development to
          support future hackathons. Additionally, I plan to continue deepening
          my understanding of vulnerability analysis in real world applications.
